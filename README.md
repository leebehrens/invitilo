# Invitilo
Like the name says in Esperanto, a command prompt. But with themes and more.

invitilo: üíª Signo a≈≠ mesaƒùo, montrata surekrane por indiki, ke la programo atendas enigaƒµon de la uzanto. [PIV2020](https://vortaro.net/#invitilo_kdc)

Command prompt: A sign or message shown on screen to indicate that the program is waiting for input from the user.

## Why yet another themed command prompt?
Look! A shiny programming challenge to solve.

It started with a few simple formatting changes to `PS1` in my `.bashrc`. Then it was ensuring the prompt always started on a new line. Up next was how to format the Python virtual environment indicator when it appeared in the prompt. And then Git branch info.

By then, I (again) ran across a few screen shots with [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline)-like command prompts of varying themes. Hmm...

Look! Another shiny programming challenge to solve.

## Some things I learned along the way
- Available prompt features
- A lot of nifty features in Bash
- Locating the cursor position in the terminal
- Curious quirks Linux environments
- Python virtual environment state
- Determine the active Git branch and related info
- GitHub release automation
